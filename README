This code ramdomly chooses parameters for a given equation and then tests if it is chaotic, stable, periodic, etc.
If it is chaotic saves the information about the used parameters and the initial values to a text file and the attractor to a ppm file.

Instructions of how to change the equations, parameters or initial conditions are in comments inside the code.

Use it to whatever end you want. IF this makes you rich remember me (:
