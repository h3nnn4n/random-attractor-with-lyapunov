This code ramdomly chooses parameters for a given equation and then tests if it is chaotic, stable, periodic, etc.
If it is chaotic saves the information about the used parameters and the initial values to a text file and the attractor to a ppm file.

There are two output files, one binary txt and one p3 netpbm file. 

The binary txt file have the follow information in that specific order:
xmin = the smallest value that x gets
ymin = the smallest value that y gets	
xmax = the biggest value that x get
ymax = the biggest value that y gets
a1 = the twelve parameters that defines the attractor
a2
...
a12

The p3 netpbm format is a file format that can easily be converted to any other format, using ffmpeg or imagemagick, for example.

Instructions of how to change the equations, parameters or initial conditions are in comments inside the code.

Use it to whatever end you want. IF this makes you rich remember me (:
